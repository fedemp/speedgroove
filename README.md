# SpeedGroove

Check what is currently playing in Grooveshark from Opera Speed Dial.

When you first install this extension, it will add a new shortcut to Grooveshark on Speed Dial.

While your listening to music in Grooveshark, the shortcut will show the current song, plus the shortcut will focus your current Grooveshark sessión.
